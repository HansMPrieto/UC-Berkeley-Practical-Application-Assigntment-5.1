The purpose of this project was to determine what type of individuals would be more likely to accept a coupon while driving. For this exercise, we investigated the Bar Coupons, and then for my independent investigation, I investigated the Coffee House Coupons.


When investigating the data for the Bar Coupons, there was a 41% overall acceptance rate for these coupons. I then checked to see the acceptance rates for those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month, and compared it to the acceptance rate for those who went more. For those who went to the bar 3 or fewer times a month, the acceptance rate was 52.74%, wheras for those who went to a bar more than 3 times a month, the acceptance rate was 76.88%. Therefore, drivers who went to a bar more than 3 times a month would be more likely to accept the Bar coupon than those who only went to the bar 3 or fewer times a month. 

I then checked and compared the acceptance rates between drivers over 25 who go to the bar more than once a month to drivers who were 21 or below. For drivers over age 25 who go to the bar more than once a month, the acceptance rate was 69.52%, whereas for drivers who were age 21 or below, the acceptance rate was 67.05%. Thus, drivers over age 25 are more likely to accept the Bar Coupon than drivers who were age 21 or below. 

Afterwards, I calculated the acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry. The acceptance rate for this condition was 70.19%.

I then compared the acceptance rate between drivers who:
- Go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed.
- Go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30
- Go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month, with an income less than 50K.

For the drivers who had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed, the acceptance rate for the Bar coupon was 70.19%. For the drivers who were under the age of 30, the acceptance rate was 72.17%. For the drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month with an income less than 50k, the acceptance rate was 45.35%. In general, those who are under the age of 30 would be more likely to accept the bar coupon.


When investigating the data for the Coffee House Coupons, I did an approach similar to when I investigated the Bar Coupons. There was a 49.92% overall acceptance rate for the Coffee House coupons. I then checked to see the acceptance rates for those who went to a Coffee House 3 or fewer times a month, and compared it to the acceptance rate for those who went more. For those who went to a Coffee House 3 or fewer times a month, the acceptance rate was 56.35%, whereas for those who went to a Coffee House more than 3 times a month, the acceptance rate was 67.5%. Therefore drivers who went to a Coffee House more than 3 times a month would be more likely to accept the Coffee House coupon, than those who only went to a Coffee House 3 or fewer times a month.

I then checked and compared the acceptance rates between drivers over 25 who go to the Coffee House more than once a month to drivers who were 21 or below. For drivers over 25 who go to the Coffee House more than once a month, the acceptance rate was 63.84%, whereas for drivers who were 21 or below, the acceptance rate was 71.28%. Thus, drivers age 21 or below would be more likely to accept the Coffee House coupon than drivers over age 25.

For drivers who go to Coffee Houses more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry, the acceptance rate was 67.12%.

For the drivers who had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed, the acceptance rate for the Coffee House coupon was 67.12%. For the drivers who were under the age of 30, the acceptance rate was 68.93%. For the drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month with an income less than 50k, the acceptance rate was 54.30%. In general, those who are under the age of 30 would be more likely to accept the Coffee House coupon.
